										<h2>DioGra</h2>
									</div>
									<p>
										A Graph Tree and Document style Dialogue Tool for Unity, making use of the new UI Toolkit and updated to newer versions of Unity than Fungus. <br />
										Built and added to occasionally during my final year in University and working as a test bed for my thesis.

										<h2>UIToolKit Buttons Hookup </h2>
									</div>
									<p>
										A truly simple bit of C# code that makes prototyping easier with the UI Toolkit in Unity. 
										Don't gotta bother a coder to hook things up for you, just do it the old way with an object in the scene and test away!

										<h2>A Lego Style Save System </h2>
									</div>
									<p>
										As the name implies, it's a save system built on the idea that any part of it should be easily replacable as needs arrise during development.
										It also only requires you to modify a single script when you wish to change what data is saved. 
										Everything else is done in the objects of the scene themselves.

									<h2>2020 to 2023 - Studies in Information Technology</h2>

										This is the year I went back to my passions, after a year of teaching and assisting the IT Administrator at Rävlanda Skolan
										I decided to study Automation at the University of Skövde, partially transitioning to Engineering by year two.<br />
										This would also be where I got my first real taste of C++

										I spent this year teaching students with learning dissabilities and those who needed extra help at Rävlanda Skolan 
										I also gradually begin to assist the IT Administrator, as they were short staffed and I had some degree of technical know how

									<h2>2016 to 2017 - Studying, Studying and more Studying</h2>
									<p>
										There are those who go to university to learn, and there are those who somewhat foolishly decide that doing a double degree isn't enough
										I was in the latter category, suffice it to say I overdid it. 
										I learned a lot though, studying Socionomy, Psychology, Law, Economy and every other class I could sneak into at the University of Gothenburg.<br />
										It did tire me on learning for a bit, so instead... I went to teach!
